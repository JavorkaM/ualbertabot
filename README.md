UAlbertaBot - StarCraft AI Competition Bot

Author:  David Churchill (dave.churchill@gmail.com)

Update: Feb 27, 2020
- UAlbertaBot now uses VS2019
- UAlbertaBot now uses BWAPI 4.4.0. To get it to compile, you have to compile BWAPI.lib and BWAPIClient.lib with VS2019 and put them in the BWAPI_INSTALL_DIR/lib/ folder
- UAlbertaBot no longer uses BWTA - it is replaced with the custom BaseLocationManager from CommandCenter

Please check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/davechurchill/ualbertabot/wiki) for full instructions and documentation!
